# Bank-Customer-Churns-Prediction
This project aim to apply predictive analytics tools to predict customer churn in the bank. Since identifying factors that affect churn rate and develop corresponding strategies are extremely important, rather than applying difficult model, I decided to use Logistic Regression, which is simple but one of the most interpretable models, for prediction. I also used MLP to help me improve my logistic regression model. Eventually, the Logistic Regression has improved from 80% accuracy to 85.3% accuracy.
